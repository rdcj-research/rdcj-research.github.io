**Exploring epistemology, symbolic systems, and computational emergence** ([ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0362-1994))

My work seeks to formalise [**symbolic resonance**](https://www.symbolicresonance.com)—the interplay of structure, intention, and pattern—as a framework for understanding knowledge, computation, and cultural cognition. Bridging mathematics, music, and philosophy, I investigate how symbolic systems (ancient and modern) encode meaning, resolve contradictions, and model emergence. [Drawing on 25+ years of interdisciplinary inquiry](https://www.rdcjazinski.com), I develop frameworks and tools that explore how structure, intention, and pattern give rise to meaning across domains.

**Guiding Question**:  
*How can structural principles reconcile the rigidity of formal logic with the fluidity of human cognition?*

## Research Axes

My work develops along three intersecting axes:

1. **Formal Systems and Emergence** – Prime Complexity, Intent Cube, symbolic geometry.  
2. **Epistemology and Scientific Method** – Catalogues, The Fretless Mind, knowledge theory.  
3. **Cultural Symbolic Systems** – I Ching, Runes, Ifá, codon logic, music as computation.

Each axis supports the others—symbolic resonance as method, structure, and lens.

## Research Focus

This repository curates my independent research portfolio. It serves as a public record of ongoing investigations into the foundations of science, consciousness, and computation—viewed through a symbolic and harmonic lens.

**Primary themes include:**
- Symbolic Computation and Geometric Information  
- Harmonic Structures and Resonance Models  
- Epistemological Frameworks and Knowledge Theory  
- Prime Complexity and Emergent Mathematical Systems  
- Cognitive Interfaces and Intentional Geometry  
- Historical Symbolic Systems and Decision Frameworks  
- Music Theory, Modal Structures, and Tuned Time

## Current Projects

- **Catalogue of Scientific Methods**  
  A comparative structural overview of empirical frameworks and their evolution.
- **Catalogue of Epistemological Foundations**  
  A taxonomy of knowledge theories across history and logic.
- **Catalogue of Symbolic Computation and Symbolic Systems**  
  A comprehensive reference to the foundations, tools, and traditions of symbolic reasoning, computation, and structure across cultures and disciplines.

### **Epistemology and Scientific Method**  
My work rethinks knowledge systems through structural and symbolic principles, focusing on frameworks that bridge logic, intuition, and cultural cognition.  

- **Catalogue of Epistemological Foundations**  
  A **neutral taxonomy** of knowledge theories across history, cultures, and disciplines:  
  - Documents frameworks (e.g., **Bayesian probability**, **dialectical materialism**, **hermeneutic cycles**) without advocacy.  
  - Organizes epistemes by structure, assumptions, and cultural context.  
  - Designed as a reference work for cross-disciplinary analysis.  

- **Catalogue of Scientific Methods**  
  A **descriptive (non-prescriptive)** mapping of empirical and theoretical workflows:  
  - Classifies methods (e.g., **hypothetico-deductive**, **abductive**, **phenomenological**) by input/output logic.  
  - Compares historical shifts (e.g., Aristotelian→Galilean→Popperian transitions).  
  - Serves as a structured overview for methodological transparency.  

- **Catalogue of Symbolic Computation and Symbolic Systems**  
  A **comprehensive reference** to the foundations, tools, and traditions of symbolic reasoning:
  - Covers **formal systems** (e.g., algebra, logic, automata, rewriting systems) **and informal traditions** (e.g., I Ching, runic scripts, alchemical diagrams).
  - Explores **symbolic modelling** in mathematics, language, music, myth, and computation.
  - Highlights structural parallels between **cultural artefacts and computational logic**.
  - Maps the evolution of **symbolic tools from ritual to machine**, across historical and epistemic contexts.
  - Intended as a **foundational resource** for symbolic science, structural modelling, and meaning-driven computation.

### **Formal Systems and Emergence**  
Mathematical and computational frameworks for modelling symbolic resonance and complexity.  

- **Prime Complexity Series**  
  Investigates prime number structures as emergent harmonic systems:  
  - Visualizes prime gaps, twin primes, and Ulam spirals as resonant waveforms.  
  - Develops symbolic algorithms for prime-pattern prediction.  

- **Intent Cube and Base Cube Systems**  
  Geometric interfaces for mapping symbolic transformation:  
  - 3D models of intent propagation (e.g., decision trees as harmonic lattices).  
  - Interactive demos linking geometric logic to musical tuning systems.  

- **Symbolic Geometry**  
  Unifies geometric and algebraic representations of knowledge:  
  - Graph-theoretic models of epistemic networks.  
  - Category theory applied to cultural symbolic systems.  

- **Codon Cube and Symbolic Genetics**  
  A 6-bit harmonic framework for genetic coding:  
  - Maps codon-amino acid relationships to combinatorial resonance.  
  - Probes parallels between genetic and cultural "code" evolution.

### Symbolic Systems Research

- **I Ching Computation Models**  
  Exploring the I Ching as a binary-based symbolic system of decision-making, emergence, and resonance.  
  Includes decoding of hexagram logic, harmonic mappings, and interface prototypes.

- **Runes and Prime Mirrors**  
  Investigation into the 18, 24, and 16 rune systems through harmonic, prime, and symbolic structures.  
  Includes Odin’s 18 Ljóð mapped to 19TET, base-2 folding systems, and cultural-symbolic computation.

- **Divination Systems as Embedded Logic**  
  Cross-cultural analysis of divinatory systems (e.g., Yoruba, Mayan vigesimal) as early computational and epistemological tools.

These systems are treated not mystically, but as **formal symbolic technologies**—models of orientation, resonance, and recursive decision-making within cultural cognition.

## **Methodologies**  
My work integrates diverse frameworks to study symbolic systems, harmonizing rigor with creativity:  

### **1. Formal Symbolics**  
- **Graph Theory**: Mapping epistemic networks and symbolic dependencies.  
- **Category Theory**: Analyzing structural equivalences across cultural, mathematical, and computational systems.  
- **Geometric Logic**: Modeling harmonic principles in topological spaces.  

### **2. Computational Modeling**  
- **Algorithmic Prototyping**: Python and JavaScript for symbolic resonance simulations.  
- **AI Tooling**: Jupyter notebooks and open-source libraries for emergent pattern detection.  

#### **Long-Term Goals**  
- **Formal Verification**: Apply tools like TLA+ or Coq to ensure symbolic frameworks are paradox-free.  
- **Cross-Domain Toolkits**: Develop open libraries for symbolic reasoning and structural resonance modelling.  

### **3. Historical & Cross-Cultural Analysis**  
- **Comparative Symbology**: Studying divinatory systems as proto-computational frameworks.  
- **Epistemic Archaeology**: Reconstructing decision-making logics in ancient systems.  
- **Critical Hermeneutics**: Interpreting cultural symbols through resonant and geometric lenses.  

### **4. Interdisciplinary Synthesis**  
- **Resonance Mapping**: Identifying isomorphic patterns across music, mathematics, and cognition.  
- **Intentional Design**: Developing interfaces to visualize symbolic transformation.
