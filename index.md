Exploring symbolic systems, harmonic epistemology, and computational emergence  

My work seeks to formalise **symbolic resonance**—the interplay of structure, intention, and pattern—as a framework for understanding knowledge, computation, and cultural cognition. Bridging mathematics, music, and philosophy, I investigate how symbolic systems (ancient and modern) encode meaning, resolve contradictions, and model emergence. Drawing on 25+ years of interdisciplinary inquiry, I develop frameworks and tools that explore how structure, intention, and pattern give rise to meaning across domains.

**Guiding Question**:  
*How can harmonic principles reconcile the rigidity of formal logic with the fluidity of human cognition?*

## Research Axes

My work develops along three intersecting axes:

1. **Formal Systems and Emergence** – Prime Complexity, Intent Cube, symbolic geometry.  
2. **Epistemology and Scientific Method** – Catalogues, The Fretless Mind, knowledge theory.  
3. **Cultural Symbolic Systems** – I Ching, Runes, Ifá, codon logic, music as computation.

Each axis supports the others—symbolic resonance as method, structure, and lens.

### **Epistemology and Scientific Method**  
My work rethinks knowledge systems through harmonic principles, focusing on frameworks that bridge logic, intuition, and cultural cognition.  

- **The Fretless Mind**  
  A treatise reframing epistemology as a *harmonic process*—balancing contradiction, recursion, and resonance.  
  - Explores "intentional geometry" as a bridge between formal logic and creative cognition.  
  - Proposes harmonic axioms for resolving paradoxes in symbolic AI.  

- **Catalogue of Epistemological Foundations**  
  A **neutral taxonomy** of knowledge theories across history, cultures, and disciplines:  
  - Documents frameworks (e.g., **Bayesian probability**, **dialectical materialism**, **hermeneutic cycles**) without advocacy.  
  - Organizes epistemes by structure, assumptions, and cultural context.  
  - Designed as a reference work for cross-disciplinary analysis.  

- **Catalogue of Scientific Methods**  
  A **descriptive (non-prescriptive)** mapping of empirical and theoretical workflows:  
  - Classifies methods (e.g., **hypothetico-deductive**, **abductive**, **phenomenological**) by input/output logic.  
  - Compares historical shifts (e.g., Aristotelian→Galilean→Popperian transitions).  
  - Serves as a structured overview for methodological transparency.

### **Formal Systems and Emergence**  
Mathematical and computational frameworks for modelling symbolic resonance and complexity.  

- **Prime Complexity Series**  
  Investigates prime number structures as emergent harmonic systems:  
  - Visualizes prime gaps, twin primes, and Ulam spirals as resonant waveforms.  
  - Develops symbolic algorithms for prime-pattern prediction.  

- **Intent Cube and Base Cube Systems**  
  Geometric interfaces for mapping symbolic transformation:  
  - 3D models of intent propagation (e.g., decision trees as harmonic lattices).  
  - Interactive demos linking geometric logic to musical tuning systems.  

- **Symbolic Geometry**  
  Unifies geometric and algebraic representations of knowledge:  
  - Graph-theoretic models of epistemic networks.  
  - Category theory applied to cultural symbolic systems.  

- **Codon Cube and Symbolic Genetics**  
  A 6-bit harmonic framework for genetic coding:  
  - Maps codon-amino acid relationships to combinatorial resonance.  
  - Probes parallels between genetic and cultural "code" evolution.

### Symbolic Systems Research

- **I Ching Computation Models**  
  Exploring the I Ching as a binary-based symbolic system of decision-making, emergence, and resonance.  
  Includes decoding of hexagram logic, harmonic mappings, and interface prototypes.

- **Runes and Prime Mirrors**  
  Investigation into the 18, 24, and 16 rune systems through harmonic, prime, and symbolic structures.  
  Includes Odin’s 18 Ljóð mapped to 19TET, base-2 folding systems, and cultural-symbolic computation.

- **Divination Systems as Embedded Logic**  
  Cross-cultural analysis of divinatory systems (e.g., Yoruba, Mayan vigesimal) as early computational and epistemological tools.

These systems are treated not mystically, but as **formal symbolic technologies**—models of orientation, resonance, and recursive decision-making within cultural cognition.

## **Methodologies**  
My work integrates diverse frameworks to study symbolic systems, harmonizing rigor with creativity:  

### **1. Formal Symbolics**  
- **Graph Theory**: Mapping epistemic networks and symbolic dependencies.  
- **Category Theory**: Analyzing structural equivalences across cultural, mathematical, and computational systems.  
- **Geometric Logic**: Modeling harmonic principles in topological spaces.  

### **2. Computational Modeling**  
- **Algorithmic Prototyping**: Python and JavaScript for symbolic resonance simulations.  
- **AI Tooling**: Jupyter notebooks and open-source libraries for emergent pattern detection.  

#### **Long-Term Goals**  
- **Formal Verification**: Apply tools like TLA+ or Coq to ensure symbolic frameworks are paradox-free.  
- **Cross-Domain Toolkits**: Develop open libraries for harmonic epistemology modelling.  


### **3. Historical & Cross-Cultural Analysis**  
- **Comparative Symbology**: Studying divinatory systems as proto-computational frameworks.
